# Word cloud python documentation
It allows to generate a word cloud, from the information obtained from a database, which is generated by a **search spider** program.

The program works by mapping the database, to read each of the links, and then make a dictionary that contains all the words used; this dictionary counts the frequency in which the words used appear in the *Python documentation*.

**Note**: the word cloud is created with the information (the words), obtained from the *Python documentation*.

As a result, we will have a visualization generated with the [D3 JavaScript library](https://d3js.org/).

## Search spider
It is a set of programs that perform search engine functions and store the data obtained in a database; its function is to crawl a website and extract a series of pages by recording the links between the pages in the database. The program randomly chooses the links that have not yet been visited on the web.
